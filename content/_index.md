Hi, I'm Michael Goodale. 
Currently I'm working as a research assistant at Institut Jean-Nicod at École normale supérieure where I am working with Prof. Salvador Mascarenhas.
My research interests largely lay at the interface of formal semantics, cognitive psychology and natural language processing.
I am particularly interested in neurosymbolic models of conceptual processing and reasoning more generally.

I did a master's degree at ENS where my master's thesis developed a model of conceptual processing where the core primitives of formal semantics, discrete sets, are replaced with continuous representations like manifolds.
This was to develop a novel account of privative adjectives, generic statements, and classical reasoning errors like conjunction fallacy.
