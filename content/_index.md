Hi, I'm Michael Goodale. 
Currently I'm working as a research assistant at [Institut Jean-Nicod](http://www.institutnicod.org/?lang=fr) at [École normale supérieure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)) where I am working with [Prof. Salvador Mascarenhas](https://web-risc.ens.fr/~smascarenhas/).
Our current project is looking at pragmatic implicatures in natural language inference systems which is generously funded by a grant from [PRAIRIE](https://prairie-institute.fr/)

My research interests largely lie at the interface of formal semantics, cognitive psychology and natural language processing.
I am particularly interested in neurosymbolic models of conceptual processing and reasoning more generally.

I did a master's degree in cognitive science at ENS where I developed a model of conceptual processing where the core primitives of formal semantics, discrete sets, are replaced with continuous representations, namely manifolds.
This was to develop a novel account of privative adjectives, generic statements, and classical reasoning errors like conjunction fallacy. 
You can find a copy of it [here on lingbuzz](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/006797).

You can download my full résumé [here](/documents/resume-michael-goodale.pdf).
